# Laravel - The PHP Framework for web artisans || HulkApps Task

## Task Objective
Creation of a backend RESTful API using PHP. Specifically, creating a backend that is fast and secured by some form of authentication, for example Token, Passport, Sanctum or JWT authentication. In addition to the previous requirement, the application should have a database seeder in order to avoid creating the database manually for testing purposes each time tha api is required.

So in short, the following requirements need to be met in order to conclude that the api was developed successfully:
- Database creation
- Database seeding
- Database migrations
- Proof of api working using postman screenshots or explaining postman usage for api
- Routes
- Authentication
- Query Filtration

## USING THE FRAMEWORK FOR EASIER CREATION

Since the framework that is being used for this project is Laravel, the task can be very easily created with laravel and composer. The reason for this is that in order to minimize time for the creation of a complex backend with php, where the developer would have to create the connection, database, seeders, migrations and routes, the laravel framework makes it easier to have all the files preloaded into the desired application. Once the files packaged with laravel are loaded, then the editing can be done
